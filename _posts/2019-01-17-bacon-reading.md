Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability.

读书使人愉悦，美人外在，长人才干. 

Their chief use for delight, is in privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in discourse;
and for ability, is in the judgment and disposition of bussiness. 

读书，使人愉悦见之于独处闲暇之时；美人外在见之于演讲论说之时；长人才干见之于事务安排决断之时. 

For expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of particulars, one by one; but the general counsels,
and the plots and marshalling of affairs, come best from those that are learned.

练达之人长于细节，而全局审计，事宜编排梳理，以博学好读之人见长. 

To spend too much time in studies is sloth;to use them too much for ornament,is affectation; to make jugment 
wholly by their rules, is the humour of scholar. 

拼命读书而不思考是惰怠；滥用书中词句是矫饰；追根究底，固守规则是学者的幽默. 

They perfect nature, and are perfected by experience: for natural abilities are like natural plants, 
that need pruning by study; and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except 
they be bounded in by experience.  

读书补天然之不足，阅历又补读书之不足: 天生的才能如同自然的植物，需要通过学习进行修剪; 学习本身帮助人在最大限度提升自己, 
除非它们为经验所束缚.

Crafty men contemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them; for they teach not their own use; 
but that is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation. 

狡猾的人批判书籍，浅薄的人敬畏书籍，而智慧的人运用书籍；书籍所授除了书中的道理外，还有一种书外的、在书籍之上的智慧，
需要通过观察来赢得. 

Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; 
but to weigh and consider. 

读书不是去质疑和批驳；不是去盲从和尊为教条；不是去高谈阔论；而是去衡量和思索. 

Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, 
some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, 
and with diligence and attention. 

有些书籍应当浅尝辄止，有些书应当囫囵吞下，只有极少数的书需要细细咀嚼和消化；所言之意是，有些书籍只需要读其部分，

Some books also may be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others; but that would be only in less important arguments, 
and the meaner sort of books, else distilled books are, like common distilled water, flashy things. 

有些书应当借他人之眼阅读，由他人代为提炼出重点. 但这仅仅适用于那些不甚重要的内容. 而那些意味深长的内容，经他人之手提炼，
就仿佛被蒸馏过的水，空无一物.

Reading makes a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man. 

读书健全人的心智，讨论使人思维敏捷，写作让人心思缜密.

And therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great memory; if he confer little, he had need have a present wit; 
and if he read little, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know that he does not.

因此，不经常写作的人，他需要有强大的记忆力. 不经常讨论的人，他需要有天生的智慧. 不经常阅读的人，需要足够的机敏去知道他
所不知道的东西.
